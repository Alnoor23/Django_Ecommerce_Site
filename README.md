# Django E-commerce Site

Fully working Django E-commerce site except for Payment Gateway and search feature. I may update it in the future for improvements and optimizations. (Not Running Live site from this code).

## Getting Started
Install the virtualenv package.
```sh
pip install virtualenv
```

Create the virtual environment.
```sh
virtualenv env 
```

Activate the virtual environment
```sh
env\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
source env/bin/activate  # For Mac OS / Linux
```

Install Django and Pillow
```sh
pip install django==3.1.7 Pillow  # You can chain these together or install them separately
```

Start local server 
```sh
python manage.py runserver  # Change into the root directory of the project before running this.
```

to Deactivate VirtualEnv
```sh
deactivate
```

> Happy Coding
